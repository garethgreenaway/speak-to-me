I've been using virtualenvwrapper to keep Python environments mostly separate and tidy:

mkvirtualenv --system-site-packages speak-to-me

There is a requirements.txt file inside the django folder than can be used by python to install all the necessary python bits.

pip install -r django/requirements.txt

Will need to edit django/mysite/localsettings.py and adjust for your environments.

Certain tasks are using Django-Celery, which uses a MQ broker, I'm using rabbitmq with it.

python manage.py celery worker --loglevel=debug

You'll also need LibreOffice in headless mode running, used to convert docs, etc. into PDFs.

/usr/lib/libreoffice/program/soffice.bin --headless --nologo --nofirststartwizard --accept="socket,host=127.0.0.1,port=2002;urp"

Logins are using Mozilla Persona, the SITE_URL variable inside settings.py should be adjusted to the URL of the site, eg. http://localhost:8080
