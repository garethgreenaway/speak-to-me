            <p>In events across the country, experts on a wide range of topics are speaking at various venues from individual speaking engagements to expos and gatherings aimed at a particular theme or genre. $THIS_PAGE provides you with up-to-date schedules and other pertinent information on speakers and presentations that are important to you. In addition, you can set up a asldkfas;dlfjasd where you can be notified when a speaker who piques your interest is giving a talk or presentation that you'd like to see.</p>
            <div class="spacer-single"> </div>
            <h4>
            <img class="bs-icon" src="/static/img/glyphicons/png/glyphicons_005_car.png"> Want to know when a favorite topic is being presented close by?
            <hr />      
            </h4>
            <p>You have a favorite topic and you might think it's either too unique or too focused to be of interest to anyone else. Not so: It's easily conceivable that others have the same interests, and that there's a speaker – or several – giving a talk or presentation on the topic of issue that interests you. Not only that, chances are that a speaker or presentation is close by. $THIS_PAGE helps you find presentations and speakers in your area or region, providing you a schedule of events tailored to your interests and geographical location.</p>
            <div class="spacer-single"> </div>            
            <h4>
            <img class="bs-icon" src="/static/img/glyphicons/png/glyphicons_343_thumbs_up.png"> Rate speakers and presentations you've seen.
            <hr />
            </h4>
            <p>So you've gone to an event, and you thought the speaker – and the presentation – were both clearly oustanding. Or you went to see a speaker and you thought he or she was lukewarm – or worse. You think others should know about it. Want to grade them? Here's your chance. $THIS_PAGE give you the opportunity to give the speaker and/or presentation a rating for the benefit of others who ould like to see this speaker in the future.</p>
